# rPlace 2 - An open source faithful recreation of r/place

This site aims to be as similar to the april fools r/place event, where users were given a 2000x2000px canvas, allowing anyone to draw a single on it at a time. 

"Alone you can create something, but together, you can create something more" (or something like that)
